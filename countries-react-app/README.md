### Countries project 🌏

1. Complete a countries react app with a list, search and single country display page. Get comfortable with using react router.
2. Add a login page, protect the search page from being accessed unless the user has logged in
3. Create a fully fledged app, user has to sign in to access any front end routes, a user can then go to a specific country and click a "visited country" checkbox
4. User will then have a page that displays all the countries they've visited

### Notes 

1. Simple backend that borrows from what we already have used
2. A current user endpoint that verifies the token
